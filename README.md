# Machine-Learning-AI
This project aims to build a classifier for detecting faces wearing glasses vs no glasses.
The dataset is generated usingGenerative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN), which consists of feature vectors of images
of individuals wearing glasses or not wearing glasses. Dataset is available on kaggle.
The aim of this project is to see how the accuracy of the Neural Network changes with the complexity of the model, for this purpose we begin with a small network and gradually increase the number of layers evaluating change in performance.
